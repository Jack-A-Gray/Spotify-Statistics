## Introduction
In the era of digital music, streaming platforms like Spotify significantly influence music consumption and artist visibility. Our project focuses on understanding the dynamics of Spotify's top charts in the United States. We explore several factors such as artist, genre, tempo, collaboration, and song valence to determine their impact on a song's likelihood to hit the top charts. This analysis could provide valuable insights for artists and record labels aiming to optimize their music production and marketing strategies.

## Project Overview
Utilizing a dataset from Kaggle featuring Spotify's "Weekly Top Songs" across various countries, we concentrated on the U.S. market data from the first six months of 2022. By narrowing down 1.8 million entries to 8,097 relevant records, our analysis provides a focused look at the factors influencing chart success in the U.S. We maintained data integrity, especially with special characters and duplicates, using Excel and APEX Oracle tools to ensure precise analysis.
